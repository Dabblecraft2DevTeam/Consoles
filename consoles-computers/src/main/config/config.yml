#
#   GENERAL SETTINGS
#

# Enable the crafting of computers
allow-comptuer-crafting: true

# Computer crafting limit for normal players.
# The permissions computer.limit.ignore will override this
computer-limit: 3

# Command prefix when sending commands to a computer. You may
# want to change this for BungeeCord servers, as it will
# interrupt commands that may have been designated for a computer.
#
# You may also leave this value blank to allow all text to be
# forwarded to computers.
command-prefix: /

# If set to true, this will hide all 'Computers saving...'
# messages
hide-save-messages: false

# Debug mode. Useful for developers, this option will print stack traces
# for every runtime Lua program crash (showing internal stack traces), and
# various information about computer data saving/loading along with other
# odds and ends.
#
# If you think there is something wrong with a Lua function call into
# Consoles, you can enable this to get the full stack trace.
debug-mode: false

# Enables a debug hook, launching a specified debug command when
# the plugin starts. Only use this command if you need to
# use a debugger to backtrace a JVM crash.
debug-hook: false

# The command to use for the debug hook. You can use the %N
# variable for a 'name' to be generated for the debug session,
# %I for the processes PID, and %E for the path of the native
# loaded library. Arguments are separated by  commas (,) to
# properly pass arguments to the newly spawned process.
#
# By default, this command will start GDB in a seperate
# terminal on Linux. You can uncomment the second line
# if you need a command for a headless server install.

#
#   FUNCTION SETTINGS
#

# Custom frame rendering for Lua programs, disable if you do
# not want players to use this.
#
# If you are concerned about players exploiting frame rendering
# to slow down your server or lag out players adjacent to a
# computer, then it is best to disable this.
#
# For the most part, though, this is relatively safe to keep on.
frame-rendering: true

# Size (in kilobytes) of the chunks that wget downloads every
# 300ms. Increasing this value will result in higher download
# speeds.
wget-chunk-size: 2

#
#   PROGRAM SETTINGS
#

# The script interpreter to use. The provided options are:
#
#  - luajit: a lua interpreter that uses a JIT compiler
#    for very fast execution (experimental, native)
#
#  - lua: default lua interpreter and environment
#    (experimental, native)
#
#  - luaj: a lua interpreter that precompiles logic
#    to java bytecode prior to execution (default, java)
#
# Depending on the interpreter, security and sandboxing is
# subject to the implementation. For example, interpreters
# that operate on the JVM, rather than through the native
# layer that this plugin uses (LuaN), share the same heap
# that the server runs on, resulting in easily-exploitable
# OutOfMemoryErrors in your server.
#
# Interpreters/VMs that operate through the native layer
# do not have to respect the suggested heap size and operate
# outside of the Java heap.
script-engine: luaj

# This is the interval (in instructions) in which kill
# interrupts are checked in programs. This applies to
# scripts.
#
# An 'instruction' is abstract, it could represent Java
# bytecode, or an instruction on your platform's architecture
interrupt-check-interval: 200

# Maximum time (in miliseconds) that a program can run without
# calling a blocking function You can tweak this to be lower
# if you want to avoid program threads from using too server
# resources.
max-time-without-interrupt: 7000

# Suggested heap size for each individual script (in kilobytes)
#
# This currently does not work for LuaJ (JVM-based), and both
# the standard Lua interpreter and LuaJIT need to be compiled
# with custom stack sizes to change heap sizes, rather than
# this variable.
#
# LuaJIT by default is compiled with the macro 'LUAI_MAXSTACK'
# set to 65500, which results in less that 64 KB of heap space
# for scripts.
#
# The only thing this setting is used for is for non-standard
# Lua VMs that have the ability to set stack sizes without
# recompiling.
script-heap-size: 65536
